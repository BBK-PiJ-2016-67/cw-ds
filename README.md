# PiJ Coursework Two

## Compile & Test

```
./run.sh
```

In order to complete the coursework, you have to:

- write a class StackImpl that extends class AbstractStack

- write an implementation of interface ImprovedStack. This class cannot extend either AbstractStack or StackImpl

- add comments and stuff
- reread all interfaces
- add more tests
- rerun all tests

1. Constructors

No constructors except below:

StackImpl: This class must have only one constructor with only one parameter of type List (i.e. a stack can be created using either an ArrayList or a LinkedList as the underlying data structure).

ImprovedStackImpl: This class must have only one constructor with only on parameter of type List.
